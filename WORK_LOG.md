I don't really know how I could approach it, the quickest way I could think of is finding the length of the string, and looking for a letter and then the letter that many letters afterward. |

I found my cs1 solution to DNA, and just spent time thinking. I couldn't really come up with a good solution, so I looked up searching algorithms, but I couldn't find anything that could help with this problem set because it isn't a searching problem but like a scanning one. |

I think that I implemented the code correctly, because it passes the checks that were under 1 hour and 26 minutes. However, I realized that the sequences could have the first part be the end of the last one (like if the tag is aga, the sequence agaga has two STRs, not 1), which I didn't address in my code. |

My attempt didn't work, and I spent the last 5-10 minutes debugging. |

I deleted most of my previous code, and used the slides to help me come up with a framework for what to do next. I realized that I didn't fully understand the sliding window originally, so I spent most of my time looking at the slides and looking up how exactly the Rabin-Karp algorithm works |
| November 3 | 9:00 - 10:00 AM, 4:00 - 6:45 PM | I fully completed the problem set. I didn't fully think about when I was going to use the sliding window vs calculating a new hash yesterday, so I made sure to understand each possible case (It is a match, it isn't a match and a streak is active, it isn't a match and a streak isn't active). I then used some of the code from last time to make a new method (remove first index), and started the actual search process. I understood the matching case pretty well, but I got somewhat stuck on how to increment i when there wasn't a match. I talked to Mr. Blick about the test tricky which made me realize that I needed to decrement i when a streak was active and there was a miss. This is because the end of one str can be the start of another. I then was able to quickly do the case where there was a miss and there wasn't a streak active. |
