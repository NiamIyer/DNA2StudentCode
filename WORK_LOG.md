| October 16 |        1:10-1:45pm        |                                                                                                                                                                                                      I thought about how I could approach the problem. I don't really know how I could approach it, the quickest way I could think of is finding the length of the string, and looking for a letter and then the letter that many letters afterward. |
| October 18 |         3:45-5:15         |                                                                                   I looked up the cs50 DNA problem set to see if I could think of a quicker way. I found my cs1 solution to DNA, and just spent time thinking. I couldn't really come up with a good solution, so I looked up searching algorithms, but I couldn't find anything that could help with this problem set because it isn't a searching problem but like a scanning one. |
| October 19 | 6:10-6:40, 7:20 - 7:55 pm | I tried to implement my cs1 solution to this problem set and it took me a while because the original cs1 problem set was a little different. I think that I implemented the code correctly, because it passes the checks that were under 5 minutes. However, I realized that the sequences could have the first part be the end of the last one (like if the tag is aga, the sequence agaga has two STRs, not 1), which I didn't address in my code. |
